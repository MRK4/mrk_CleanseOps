CleanseOps is a unique FiveM script that introduces a thrilling job opportunity for players within the server.

Engage in the world of clandestine activities as a 'Cleanse Operator,' tasked with handling rivals and troublemakers.

Dive into intense operations, purging the city of unwanted elements and ensuring a harmonious environment.


## Dependencies

For the moment, the script is only compatible with QBCore.
